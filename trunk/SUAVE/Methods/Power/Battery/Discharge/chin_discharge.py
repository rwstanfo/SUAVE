    """Discharge and Cell Ageing Model:
       Discharge Model uses a thevenin equavalent circuit with parameters taken from 
       pulse tests done by NASA Glen (referece below) of a Samsung (SDI 18650-30Q).
       Cell Aging model was developed from fitting of experimental data of LiMNC 
       18650 cell.
